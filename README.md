# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-DNN

This Self-project titled "Heart Disease Prediction" project aims to provide a method for heart disease prediction. The model predicts if the patients have a heart disease or not. The dataset (available in repository) contains more than 10 features. After data visualisation, I end up with 8 features those are important for prediction. I used Federated learning on the DNN for this task and achieved around 80% accuracy.
