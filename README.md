# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-DNN

I have employed Federated Learning (FL) and conventional Centralized Machine Learning, achieving around 83.9\% accuracy for centralized learning and 80\% for FL. Following that, made an API using FastAPI for deployment into the cloud. I have used $3$ layered DNN for this task.
